  the permissions of this account an attacker might be able to:

  - gain access to sensitive files

  - upload or delete files.","If you do not want to share files, you should disable anonymous
  logins.",,"A host that provides an FTP service may additionally provide
  Anonymous FTP access as well. Under this arrangement, users do not strictly need an account on the
  host. Instead the user typically enters 'anonymous' or 'ftp' when prompted for username. Although
  users are commonly asked to send their email address as their password, little to no verification
  is actually performed on the supplied data.

  Remark: NIST don't see 'configuration issues' as software flaws so the referenced CVE has a
  severity of 0.0. The severity of this VT has been raised by Greenbone to still report a
  configuration issue on the target.","
